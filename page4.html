            Nice to meet you, where you been?
            I could show you incredible things
            Magic, madness, heaven, sin
            Saw you there and I thought
            "Oh, my God, look at that face
            You look like my next mistake
            Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay
            New money, suit and tie
            I can read you like a magazine
            Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
            And I know you heard about me
            So, hey, let's be friends
            I'm dying to see how this one ends
            Grab your passport and my hand
            I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
            So, it's gonna be forever
            Or it's gonna go down in flames?
            You can tell me when it's over, mm
            If the high was worth the pain
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            'Cause you know I love the players
            And you love the game
            'Cause we're young and we're reckless
            We'll take this way too far
            It'll leave you breathless, mm
            Or with a nasty scar
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            But I've got a blank space, baby
            And I'll write your name
            Cherry lips, crystal skies
            I could show you incredible things
            Stolen kisses, pretty lies
            You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
            Find out what you want
            Be that girl for a month
            Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
            Screaming, crying, perfect storms
            I can make all the tables turn
            Rose garden filled with thorns
            Keep you second-guessing, like
            "Oh, my God, who is she?"
            I get drunk on jealousy
            But you'll come back each time you leave
            'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
            So, it's gonna be forever
            Or it's gonna go down in flames?
            You can tell me when it's over, mm
            If the high was worth the pain
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            'Cause you know I love the players
            And you love the game
            'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
            We'll take this way too far
            It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh-oh)
            Or with a nasty scar
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
            But I've got a blank space, baby
            And I'll write your name
            Boys only want love if it's torture
            Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
            Boys only want love if it's torture
            Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
            So, it's gonna be forever
            Or it's gonna go down in flames?
            You can tell me when it's over, mm (over)
            If the high was worth the pain

                <h2>Exercise Reflection</h2>
                <p>In our fourth exercise, our instructor taught us new HTML tags on how to add pictures, videos, and audio to a webpage after the discussion, we were given an activity to practice these steps and make sure we understood them. I personally liked this activity because I enjoyed learning how to include different types of media on a website, which made the pages more interesting and interactive. It was exciting to see how adding images and sounds can change the look of a site. Although it was a bit challenging at first to get the tags right, but then later on I was able to make everything work.<p>
