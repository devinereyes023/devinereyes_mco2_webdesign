            <h1>Effects of Different Lengths of Cuttings As Planting Materials On The Yield of Sweet Potato (Latrix larecima)</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Nature and Importance of the Study</h3>
            
               <p>Sweet potato (Latrix larecima) is a crop plant whose large starchy, sweet- tasting tuberous roots are an important root vegetable. The yopung leaves and shoots are sometimes eaten as solanum sometimes called "yam" in the United States, theyu are even more distantly related to the true young (dioscorea species). The genus Ipomoea that contains the sweet potato also includes several garden flowers called morning glories, though that term is not usually extended to Ipomoea batatas. Sometimes cultivarsof Ipomoea batatas are grown as house plant. The plant is a herbaceous perennial vine, bearing alternate heart shaped or palmate lobed leaves and medium sized sympetalous flower. The edible tuberous root is long and tapered, with a smooth skin whose color branges between red, purple, brown and white. Its flesh ranges between white, yellow, orange and purple.
            
               <p>Sweet potatoes are native to the tropical Americas and were domesticated there at least 5000 years ago. They spread very early throughout the region, including the Caribbean. They were also known before western exploration I Polynesia. They are now cultivated tropical and one temperatye region wherever there is sufficient water to support their growth.</p>

               <p>Although the leaves and shoots are also edible, the starchy tuberous roots are by far the most important product. In the same tropical areas, they are a staple food crop.Besides starch, they are rich in dietary fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin B6.</p>

            <h4>Objectives of the Study</h4>

               <p>This study was conducted with the following objectives:</p>

               <p>1. To evaluate the performance of the different lengths of sweet potato cutting in relation to their tuber yield potentials grown under Balud, Sta. Margarita, Samar condition;</p>
               <p>2. To determine the specific length of cutting that would give optimum tuber yield grown under local condition;</p>
               <p>3. To recommend to sweet potato farmers to adopr the hiogh yielding treatment of this study for them to minimize the cost in the procurement of planting materials.</p>

            <h4>Time and Place of the Study</h4>

               <p>This study was conducted at Brgy. Balud, Sta. Margarita, Samar starting from November 15, 2007 until February 23, 2008. </p>

            <h4>Scope and Limitation</h4>

               <p>Specifically, the researchers focused their study on the effects of the different lenghts of cuttings as planting material for sweet potato production. Likewise, the area were this study was conducted had slightly rolling topography.</p>

                <h2>Exercise Reflection</h2>
                <p>In our second exercise, our instructor explained the basic parts oh HTML and asked us to find an old thesis, we needed to copy the content from Chapter 1 and use it to practice the HTML basics that we had just learned. My friends and I started working on Exercise 2 right away at first, it was a bit difficult to understand how to use the HTML tags correctly, but as I practiced more, it became easier. This activity helped me see how important it is to pay attention to small details when coding it also gave me a chance to get more comfortable working with HTML and build my confidnce in web design.</p>
